<p>Hi! My name is Halli. I grew up in a small town called Star Valley, Wyoming. I am currently going to school at <strong>Utah Valley University</strong> studying <em>Art Education.</em> I really enjoy doing anything outdoors, especially hiking. I also love doing art projects, traveling, playing guitar, and going to the gym. </p>
<h2>My Motive</h2>
<p>Growing up, my parents were both really into health and fitness. My dad owns and coaches at a CrossFit <a href="http://CrossFit.com" target="_blank"></a> gym in Star Valley, and he had always influenced and helped me to grow to love health and fitness as well. Moving out of the house and living on my own made it harder for me to stay disciplined. It was honestly easier and cheaper to eat Raman Noodles. Eating healthy can get <em>so</em> expensive, and it honestly can be tough to do that while being a college student. For a while, I’ve been learning more and more how to food prep and eat better, while not spending too much money! So, I have decided to share a few simple recipes that I’ve created, and my goal is to improve my diet and create a healthy lifestyle, and to inspire those who are in the same boat.</p>
<h2>Benefits of eating healthier</h2>

<ul>
        <li><strong>Better immune system</strong></li>
        <li><strong>More energy</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Less of a risk for health problems</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Clearer mind</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Can help you acheive your physical goals</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Can save money</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>What food should I purchase?</h2>
<p>Some good options that I reccomend include <strong>meat, eggs, avocado, berries, nuts, veggies,</strong> and <strong>yogurt.</strong> You can purchase these items in bulk, at Costco.<a href="http://costco.com" target="_blank"></a>
