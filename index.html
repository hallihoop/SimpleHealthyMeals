<p>My name is Halli! I recently moved to Prove, Ut. I am currently going to school at <strong>Utah Valley University</strong> studying <em>Art Education.</em> I really enjoy doing anything outdoors, especially hiking. I also love doing art projects, traveling, playing guitar, and going to the gym. Growing up, my parents were both really into health and fitness. My dad owns and coaches at a CrossFit <a href="http://CrossFit.com" target="_blank"></a> gym in Star Valley, Wyoming and has always influenced and helped me to grow to love health and fitness as well. Moving out of the house and living on my own made it harder for me to stay disciplined. But, recently Iâ€™ve been learning more and more how to food prep and eat better, while not spending too much money! So, I have decided to create some simple and healthy meals for you to try.</p>
<h1>What I Do</h1>
<p>The purpose of my website, is to show you that eating better can seriously improve your life. Eating out can get expensive, and it's not always the healthiest option. I want to point you in the right direction by offering ready-to-go meals at a great price, that I created just for you. Give my meals a try, and I can guarantee that you'll want to start cooking and eating better on your own!</p>
