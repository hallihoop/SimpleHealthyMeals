<h2>How much do you usually spend on groceries?</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The average American spends roughly between <strong>$250 - $300 a month</strong> on groceries. And thatâ€™s for one person alone!</li>
    <li>For me, I spend around <strong>$100-$150 a month.</strong></li>
    <li>And even spending that much less, I am eating plenty every single day.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How do you make food last?</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Freezers are your best friend! I usually buy meat in bulk, so that I can freeze it.</li>
    <li>I will take the food I bought in bulk and separate it into ziplock bags to freeze. Learning how to effectively prep and freeze your food will save you so much time and cost.</li>
    <li>I end up with so much food that is prepped. Your food will last if you prepare in advance.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What is meal prepping?</h2>
<ol>
Meal prepping involves preparing entire meals or dishes ahead of schedule, in bulk.<br>

    <li>I feel happier with myself, which I feel is super important.</li>
